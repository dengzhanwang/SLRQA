function Q = imreadq(varargin)
% IMREADQ  Read image from graphics file and return quaternion image array.
%
% This function takes the same parameters as the Matlab function IMREAD,
% but it returns a quaternion array, with elements of type uint8 or uint16
% depending on the pixel data in the image file (8-bit or 16-bit). The way
% the image pixel data is converted to quaternions depends on the type of
% image stored in the file as follows:
%
% 1. RGB colour image in file. The data is returned as a pure quaternion
%    array with the RGB components in the XYZ components of the quaternion.
%
% No other cases are handled at present. For more precise control over the
% conversion from image to quaternion array, use the Matlab function IMREAD
% and then code the conversion explicitly.
