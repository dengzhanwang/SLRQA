% For simplicity, but perhaps not the greatest efficiency, we use the
% quaternion cat function, and work on the two component quaternions of
% each argument. This is complicated by the fact that one or both of the
% arguments may be a pure octonion.

        % have to supply zeros for the scalar part of a with the same type
        % as the elements of a.
