function d = eps(X)
% EPS Floating-point relative accuracy.
% (Octonion overloading of standard Matlab function.)

% This function will only be called for the profile eps(X) where X is a
% octonion. It is implemented only because some Matlab functions call it,
% and if not implemented these functions will not work for octonions.

d = eps(abs(X)); % X is an octonion, abs(X) is real or complex, and the
                 % eps function called from this line will be the built-in.
