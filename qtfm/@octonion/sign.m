function Y = sign(X)
% SIGN   Signum function

% This function is equivalent to unit(X), but we implement it by calling
% the Matlab function using an isomorphic complex number. In the case where
% X is a complex octonion we have to resort to direct coding, and we call
% the octonion unit function. We could choose to use unit(X) in both
% cases, in which case sign(X) would simply be an alias for unit(X).

narginchk(1, 1), nargoutchk(0, 1)

if isreal(X)
    
    % X is a real octonion, and we compute the signum of an isomorphic
    % complex number using the standard Matlab sign function, then
    % construct an octonion with the same axis as the original octonion.
    
    Y = isooctonion(sign(isocomplex(X)), X);
else
    
    % X is a complex octonion, and therefore we cannot use the method
    % above for real octonions, because it is not possible to construct
    % an isomorphic complex number. We use instead the octonion unit
    % function.
    
    Y = unit(X);
end

% Note that a fundamental design feature of the QTFM toolbox is that it
% should implement all the standard Matlab functions and operators that
% have meaning in both the complex and octonion cases, so that complex
% code can be easily adapted to work with octonion matrices. This is why
% we provide the sign function, even though it has a synonym in the unit
% function. (Why we provide the unit function is another issue.)
