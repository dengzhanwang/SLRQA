% A three-fold cross product exists in eight dimensions (see the paper by
% Massey cited below), and hence for full octonions. If any of the three
% arguments is pure, the scalar part will be treated as zero, which does
% not invalidate the three-fold cross product.

    % TODO One day, we could implement a detailed formula here like that
    % used in the quaternion vector product, to avoid the wasted time
    % computing the unused scalar part. See Calabi where there is an
    % explicit table for computing the product in Theorem 1 (equation 2.3)

        % inner product <y, x> will be equal in magnitude but opposite in
        % sign to the scalar part of the product. Here we just take the
        % vector part of the product, rather than computing the inner
        % product in order to cancel out the scalar part. This of course
        % also has the advantage that we return a pure octonion, rather
        % than a full octonion with zero scalar part.

% TODO Check this code, and understand the results, in particular, how to
% construct a 7-dimensional orthogonal basis, with 7 mutually perpendicular
% unit pure octonions.

% TODO See: Wikipedia: Seven-dimensional cross product where the discussion
% under Generalizations suggests that there should be a six-vector product.
% This does not seem consistent with Harvey. A critical issue is how to
% construct a 7-dimensional orthonormal basis. Surely this function is the
% key, but how should it work?

%
% This paper shows how a 7-vector basis can be generated from a 3-vector
% orthonormal basis by adding a 4th basis element orthonormal to the first
% three, AND VECTOR PRODUCTS alone. But he does not say what the definition
% of the vector product is.
