function [chi, d, a, b] = peirce(q)
% PEIRCE    Peirce decomposition of an octonion.
%
% Computes a decomposition of a real octonion into a pair of conjugate
% complex eigenvalues. The eigenvalues permit functions of the octonion
% argument to be computed using complex functions (for example, powers,
% trigonometric functions).
%
% chi is the 'positive' eigenvalue. The complex conjugate of chi gives the
% 'negative' eigenvalue.
%
% d is the 'positive' idempotent. This is a bioctonion with real scalar
% part and imaginary vector part. d^2 = d (definition of an idempotent).
%
% a and b are the products of the eigenvalues and idempotents such that
% q = a + b (see code for the formula).
%
% The utility of this decomposition is that it satisfies:
%
% f(q) = f(chi) .* d* + f(chi*) .* d, where d* is the complex conjugate of
% d and chi* is the complex conjugate of chi, for a wide range of
% functions, and the RHS may be evaluated using only COMPLEX
% implementations of f(x). Note that because the two terms are conjugates,
% it is possible to compute the RHS as real(f(chi) .* d*) .* 2 with less
% computation (indeed one could go further and avoid computing the
% imaginary part rather than discarding it afterwards).

% Compute the positive idempotent. This is given in Oba, equations 2.1 and
% 3.1 (the latter defines the unit vector part of q). The negative
% idempotent (d_minus in the paper) is just the complex conjugate of the
% value below, so we do not compute it.

A = abs(vector(q));

d = (1 + 1i .* (vector(q) ./ A)) ./ 2;

% Compute the eigenvalues. These are a complex conjugate pair of complex
% numbers, so again we need compute only one of them.

chi = complex(scalar(q), A); % Oba, equation 4.3.

% Now compute the two components of the decomposition, if required (many
% applications of this function would not need them). Oba, Theorem 4.7.
