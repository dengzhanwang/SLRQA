% qj is one of the three quaternion operators.
% qj is usually denoted by j, but this symbol is used in Matlab to represent
% the complex operator (also represented by i).

q = quaternion(0, 1, 0);

% Implementation note:  j cannot be overloaded because it is a built-in Matlab
% operator. J cannot be used because Matlab does not distinguish between upper
% and lower case.
