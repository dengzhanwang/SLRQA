% z is now the vector part of x, but in some cases this value may be zero.
% These cases will correspond to the entries in undefined (maybe some
% others with very small modulus). We set all these undefined values to a
% safe temporary value, then replace the temporary value with a zero vector
% after evaluating the unit function. In order to perform the subscripted
% assignment using the logical array undefined we have to use subsasgn and
% substruct because normal indexing does not work here in a class method.
% See the file 'implementation notes.txt', item 8, for more details.
