    % X is a pure quaternion (array).  We are computing exp(X) for each
    % element of the array, and we need to factor X to give a unit pure
    % quaternion, a, and a real or complex 'angle' denoted below by theta.
    % In fact this angle is simply the absolute value of X. We then have
    % X = a .* theta, and we can calculate exp(X) from cos(theta) +
    % a .* sin(theta) (de Moivre's formula).
    %
    % If the modulus of any element of X is zero or very small, the axis
    % (a) will be undefined, and we have to take care to handle this
    % without returning NaNs, since although the axis is undefined, the
    % exponential is not. A second reason why the modulus may be small is
    % that the element in question is a nilpotent. We test for this
    % separately, because in this case the exponential is 1 + X, as can be
    % seen from the power series for e^x.
    
    theta     = abs(X);          
    
    % We have to treat undefined axis values differently according as to
    % whether X is symbolic or numeric.
    
    if isa(X.x, 'sym')
        % X is symbolic, therefore we can test for equality with zero,
        % which will work whether theta is real or complex.
        
        undefined = theta == 0;
    else
        % X is numeric. Since theta could be complex, we need abs() again
        % here to compare with eps.
        
        undefined = abs(theta) < eps;
    end
    
    cc = cos(theta); % If theta is complex, the cosine and sine will yield
    ss = sin(theta); % cosh and I.*sinh of theta.

    theta(undefined) = 1; % This prevents divide by zero in the element
                          % positions where the axis is undefined.

    a = X ./ theta; % This is equivalent to axis(X) but without warnings
                    % about undefined axis because values of theta less
                    % than eps (or zero in the case of symbolics) have been
                    % replaced with 1. This means the values at positions
                    % corresponding to undefined axis are incorrect, since
                    % we have copied the (small) value from X unmodified.
                    % However, these values will be multiplied by a zero or
                    % very small (less than eps) sine value below, so are
                    % harmless.

    Y = cc + a .* ss;
    
    % Now deal with nilpotent elements if any.
    
    if any(undefined(:))
        % Note on subscripted references: these do not work inside a class
        % method (which this is). See the file 'implementation notes.txt',
        % item 8.
        
        N = false(size(X));

        % N(undefined) = isnilpotent(X(undefined))
        
        N(undefined) = isnilpotent( ...                           
                       subsref(X, substruct('()', {undefined})));
        
        if any(N(:)) % There may be no nilpotents, in which case, skip.
            Y = subsasgn(Y, substruct('()', {N}), ...  % Y(N) = ...
                1 + subsref(X, substruct('()', {N}))); %        1 + X(N);
        end
    end
else
    
    % X is a full quaternion (array).  We use a recursive call to compute
    % the exponential of the vector part, and the standard Matlab function
    % to compute the exponential of the scalar part (which may be complex).
    % The result is the elementwise product of the two.
