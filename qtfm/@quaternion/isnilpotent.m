% Theorem 5 of the above paper gives the conditions for a biquaternion to
% be a nilpotent. The biquaternion must be pure, and the norm must be zero.

% TODO If q is symbolic we should be able to do an exact check.

% We also need to check for a non-zero imaginary part, otherwise we would
% return true for a value of zero, which is not a nilpotent in the sense
% needed here.

    tf = abs(normq(imag(q))) > tol & ...

else
    % Nilpotents must be pure, so we check that the scalar part is close to
    % zero, then check the norm of the vector part is also close to zero.
    
    tf = abs(normq(imag(q))) > tol & ...
