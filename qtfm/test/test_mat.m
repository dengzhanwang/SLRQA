% properly implemented rather than using adjoint matrices. (Accuracy with
% adjoint matrices is known to be low, especially for larger matrices.)

% TODO Work out how to avoid the warnings which arise from the unadjoint
% function, as the tests below pass. Maybe just suppress the tests in the
% unadjoint function?
