function o = oi
% oi is one of the seven octonion operators.
% oi is usually denoted by i, but this symbol is used in Matlab to represent
% the complex operator (also represented by j).

o = octonion(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);

end

% Implementation note:  i cannot be overloaded because it is a built-in Matlab
% operator. I cannot be used because Matlab does not distinguish between upper
% and lower case.
