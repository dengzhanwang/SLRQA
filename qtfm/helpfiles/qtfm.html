<h1>Quaternion Toolbox v3</h1>
<p>
The quaternion toolbox for Matlab&reg; (QTFM for short) extends
Matlab&reg; to handle vectors and matrices of quaternions.
Many quaternion-specific functions are implemented, as are overloadings of
standard Matlab&reg; functions and Matlab&reg; operators and notation.
The toolbox is intended to work as far as possible in the same way as Matlab&reg; itself.
Most functions are vectorized, and where a Matlab&reg; function is overloaded
by the toolbox, as far as possible the quaternion function accepts the same
parameters as the Matlab&reg; function.
</p>
<p>
From Version 2.0 of the toolbox onwards, octonions are also supported, in a
similar manner. Functions which are overloaded for octonions are noted as such
in the online help, but the text may refer to quaternions alone. Some functions
may not be implemented for octonions, either because we have not had the
time to code them, or because an octonion algorithm is not known.
</p>
<p>
From version 3.0 of the toolbox onwards, symbolic computation with quaternions
is supported, using the Matlab&reg; Symbolic Math Toolbox, if installed (if
not installed, symbolic functions will not work). Octonion symbolic computation
was added with the release of version 3.1.
Symbolic computation operates in the same manner as numeric
computation: a quaternion or octonion may have components which are symbolic expressions
or variables. It is not possible to define a quaternion itself to be symbolic:
this would require much more extensive coding, and quite likely a new class
to represent symbolic quaternions. Matrices of quaternions can be symbolic,
again in the same sense as for numerics: the components of a quaternion may
be symbolic matrices (of real or complex values).
</p>
<p>
For a general overview of quaternions and octonions,
and how they are handled by the
toolbox, see the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> page.
For a detailed list of functions, see the
<a href="alphabetical.html">alphabetical</a> or
<a href="categorical.html">categorized</a> lists.
</p>
<p>
Many Matlab&reg; functions will work with quaternion arrays, because all
the functions called are overloaded by the toolbox, and the semantics of
the quaternion version are consistent with what the Matlab&reg; function
expects. A <a href="matlist.html">list of these functions</a> is available.
</p>
<h2>Website</h2>
<p>
The toolbox website and Sourceforge project page may be acccessed from the
Matlab&reg; Start menu, or from the following links:<br>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="http://qtfm.sourceforge.net/">Web site at Sourceforge</a>
<li>&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtfm/">Sourceforge project page</a>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Matlab&reg; version required</h2>
<p>
Matlab&reg; Version 7.14 (R2012a) is believed to be the minimum required system to run
versions 2 or 3 of the toolbox (we don't test it ourselves with older versions than
the current or immediately prior Matlab&reg; release).
Earlier versions of the toolbox will work with Version 7.4 (R2007a).
The test code (see below) verifies the version required and documents
the reasons for requiring it.
</p>
<h2>GNU Octave compatibility (under development)</h2>
<p>
From version 1.8 onwards, we introduced some minor changes to attempt
to achieve compatibility with
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a>, but no further
work on these has been done for some time.
At present, the toolbox will not work correctly under GNU Octave.
The test code (see below) will recognise that QTFM is running under Octave,
but the tests will fail due to serious problems with the GNU Octave search
path, and the lack of recognition by GNU Octave of the toolbox directory
structure. We welcome contributions to fixing these problems, which will be
acknowledged on the <a href="contrib.html">contributors page</a>.
</p>
<h2>Test code</h2>
<p>
Some test code is provided in the directory <tt>test</tt>.
To run it type <tt>qtfm_test</tt> in the command window.
This runs all the numeric test code, and if the Matlab&reg; Symbolic Math Toolbox
is installed it will also run test code for the symbolic algebra functionality.
There may be some warnings about numerical accuracy of results,
which vary from one test run to the next, and can usually be ignored.
</p>
<h2>SVN Repository</h2>
<p>
    We use SVN for version control of files within the toolbox. Until November
    2017, we used CVS. The CVS repository was converted to SVN and therefore
    preserves most of the history of commits to the CVS repository. The CVS
    repository remains in existence for the time being, frozen at the state it
    was in at the end of November 2017.
</p>
<p>
New versions
of files are uploaded to the SVN repository at Sourceforge as we develop
them, in between releases of the toolbox. If you wish, you should be able
to set up your own SVN system to provide read-only access to the repository
and thus keep the toolbox updated in between releases. The effort of doing
this is not likely to be worthwhile unless you already know how to use SVN.
</p>
<p>
However, it may sometimes be worthwhile to check for a newer version of a
specific file, if you hit a problem. You can do this through a web interface
to the SVN repository:

<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qtfm/svncode/HEAD/tree/">Browse SVN repository</a>
at Sourceforge.
</ul>

<li>
The online help documentation for this toolbox was improved as part of a project to
create initial documentation for the <a href = "http://clifford-multivector-toolbox.sourceforge.net/">Clifford Toolbox for Matlab</a>.
These improvements were done by Ryan Stuart, working as a Frontrunner placement student
on placement number FR1516207 funded by the University of Essex from June to August 2016.
The improvements were in the styling and presentation of the main help pages, and the
styling of the individual function pages.
